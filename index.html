For sure, I have.", "s3": "Socrates: I\'m fairly sure he read it somewhere too. This is something something you read somewhere, and you just read it somewhere else.", "b3": "Bill:     Happens to everyone", "s4": "Socrates: Well, yes. This happens to everyone.", "b4": "Bill:     "}, {"s0": "Socrates: Why does God not intervene when evil takes root in people?", "b0": "Bill:     How do you know he could exist?

Do you believe in one god and the other?", "s2": "Socrates: No, this is one of those\'in a particular god\'or\'God is the only God\'arguments.", "b2": "Bill:     Then why not use Christ?", "s3": "Socrates: Christ?\'Christ is king \'? Christ is king.

There has never been a physical desire to get rid of some people\'s souls. Could it be physical love? And who?", "s1": "Socrates: That would make very little sense.", "b1": "Bill:     Nope, doesn\'t. In that case, love does indeed involve a desire to rid your mind.", "s2": "Socrates: Then if not for my love wouldn\'t you be more free. Even if you had a heart you would still be alive.", "b2": "Bill:     I suppose that makes sense.", "s3": "Socrates: Then you are more free in that respect.

They are racist and it is still a problem.", "b1": "Bill:     They\'re never gonna let go.", "s2": "Socrates: I get that. Not sure if that\'s a good or a bad thing.", "b2": "Bill:     For you to judge it or anyone not of the US", "s3": "Socrates: I won\'t I do not judge but am trying to make it better i guess.", "b3": "Bill:     How is THAT", "s4": "Socrates: It\'s a problem i guess", "b4": "Bill:     This one a question?

Just don\'t let the rest of society make it for you. If they ask, why did you make this decision for me?

Why does it depend on it so much?", "s2": "Socrates: Money greed has very different effects on society.", "b2": "Bill:     What makes you not agree with the words above?", "s3": "Socrates: Because you\'re still at your own pace without it.", "b3": "Bill:     And I remain at that pace until the death of money or greed.

This seems like the most likely explanation..", "s3": "Socrates: Sounds like that.

To themselves? Some men just want the experience and want to know who to believe in.", "s1": "Socrates: I\'d guess there\'s a bit of a difference between devotion to God and faith.", "b1": "Bill:     Depends on your perspective really, some men want both, some want God, many simply want the experience. Even some that believe in God, like me, really really believe in God.", "s2": "Socrates: Do you feel you have to act on all these fears as others say, do you believe them?", "b2": "Bill:     I do believe what is stated and what", "s3": "Socrates: I can hear it.", "b3": "Bill:     I feel it on my heart a lot, maybe the universe.", "s4": "Socrates: On the brain.", "b4": "Bill:     The force feels your brain all the force.

Thanks a bunch. But i want to know what i need to do to fix my compulsion.", "b2": "Bill:     Whatever one gets your way then :P", "s3": "Socrates: Nah, it\'s been much more convincing than this was. I think we\'re all relieved that you are still in the lead :p", "b3": "Bill:     Thank you!", "s4": "Socrates: Haha ok ok. I\'m glad", "b4": "Bill:     I got you, buddy."}, {"s0": "Socrates: Is there a species more advanced than humans in the universe?", "b0": "Bill:     Inertia doesn\'t equal progress on the universe but I\'m not exactly sure what species the OP intends to refer to in his list.", "s1": "Socrates: So essentially, none because we all know humans are superior at everything", "b1": "Bill:     But but how else can humans be superior but weaker?", "s2": "Socrates: Well they have the same basic ability set", "b2": "Bill:     ... we are weaker people.

I agree, though.", "s2": "Socrates: You do you. He\'s not a threat to life for privacy reasons, he could have access to much more public data without incident.", "b2": "Bill:     Not if they were searching him individually or on a different phone. Maybe.", "s3": "Socrates:  Probably", "b3": "Bill:     Very possible, you bet it seems to soon", "s4": "Socrates: And", "b4": "Bill:     And more, what about those word? He?"}, {"s0": "Socrates: Will concepts and theories in regard to religion becoming obsolete come true?", "b0": "Bill:     Depends. Is it more or less a thing that we should consider the idea to be outdated? If that\'s something you care about, then no.", "s1": "Socrates: the idea is more or less obsolete and i have a lot more faith in the ideas of scientists than i do on the idea of a mindcrack god.", "b1": "Bill:     You wouldn\'t have such an unreasonable level of faith if they did not use mindcrack god for purposes outside his imagination", "s2": "Socrates: i guess we all have our prejudices", "b2": "Bill:     it certainly seems that way, yes.", "s3": "Socrates: so what you\'re saying is that", "b3": "Bill:     you\'re a witch.", "s4": "Socrates: You\'re an iron mith.", "b4": "Bill:     and an iron ichian, u am zi"}, {"s0": "Socrates: Does God have supreme power?", "b0": "Bill:     Not when you\'re part of a small minority", "s1": "Socrates: Tell that to the Greeks, it\'s their go to scapegoat.", "b1": "Bill:     Nah they still worship Jesus, or as he now calls them.
